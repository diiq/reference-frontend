    <p>My name is Sam Bleckley. I am an artist and a software engineer. I got tired of trying to organize my reference photos using tools that were meant for social sharing, blogging, or family photos. I built this tool specifically for artists &mdash; well, really, specifically for me.</p>
    <p>It's just me back here. There's no software team, no marketing department, to corporate headquarters demanding higher profits. If there;s somethign you want to know, or a feature you'd like to see, reach out to me!</p>
    <p>signature or whatever, twitter link? email?</p>
